# ComfyUI-PiAPI-Faceswap
A simple ComfyUI nodes that integrates [PiAPI faceswap](https://piapi.ai/faceswap-api) service into ComfyUI. This can be helpful if you're trying to create a workflow that includes faceswap for commercial usage.

## Installation
git clone repository into ComfyUI/custom_nodes

## Usage
Add in your api_key to run the service. The node takes a base image (the image on which to perform the faceswap) and a target image (the image with the target face) as input. The node automatically crops the face and scales it for optimal performance and cost control. 

## Workflow
TBD
